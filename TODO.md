* footer is not sticky to page bottom 
* if no results by filters -> no elements to change filters, only home page

* handlers.go is over complicated for read cuz of lines amount (you may separate each handler in own file)
* I did not find migrations for database, it may be useful
* usage of autoincrement, refs and uniq in database is cool, i could suggest cascade deleting as well
overall it pass all questions
